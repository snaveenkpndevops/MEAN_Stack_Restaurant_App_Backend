MEAN STACK  --> Mongo Express Angular Node.js


### Approach

The project will be divided into two main parts:

Client-side: The client-side will be built using Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. We'll create the necessary components, services, and routing to handle the user interface and interact with the server-side.

Server-side: The server-side will be built using Node.js and Express, a web application framework for Node.js. We'll create the API endpoints, handle database operations using Mongoose, and manage Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies.
